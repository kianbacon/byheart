# By Heart - Flashcard Application

By Heart is a simple web app for creating and studying flashcards. With this app, users can create flashcard decks, add questions and answers, and review their decks to help memorize information.

This is an old project that I made with a group, but would like to improve on my own. I will use it as a learning experience and make it into something that I am proud of. 

## Features

- **Create Decks**: Organize flashcards into various decks.
- **Add Flashcards**: Create flashcards with questions and answers.
- **Study Mode**: Review your flashcards one at a time and quiz yourself.
